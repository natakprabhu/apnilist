  const categoryContentTemplates: { [key: string]: string } = {
    "Air Purifier": `
When choosing an air purifier, the main types to consider are those with HEPA filters, which excel at capturing fine particles, and those with activated carbon filters for odors and gases. Many top models from brands like Philips, Dyson, and Mi combine these technologies. Entry-level personal purifiers start around ₹7,000, while high-capacity room models can go up to ₹30,000. Their primary purpose is to remove indoor air pollutants, allergens, and dust, significantly improving residential air quality.`,
    "Chimney": `
A kitchen chimney is essential for absorbing smoke and oil particles, keeping your kitchen air clean and preventing grime. The main types are wall-mounted, island, and built-in, which use filters like baffle or charcoal. Popular brands in India include Elica, Faber, and Hindware. Prices range from ₹5,000 for basic models to ₹25,000 for high-end, auto-clean chimneys, so choosing depends on your budget and suction power needs.`,
    "Coffee Maker": `
Starting your day with the perfect brew depends on the right machine. You can choose from simple Drip Coffee Makers and French Presses (which start as low as ₹500) or more advanced Espresso Machines from brands like De'Longhi and Morphy Richards, which can cost over ₹20,000. Each type serves a different purpose, from a light, quick cup to a rich, complex espresso shot.`,
    "Juicer": `
To get your daily dose of fresh vitamins, you'll need to choose between two main types of juicers: Centrifugal and Masticating (or cold-press). Centrifugal juicers from brands like Philips or Sujata are fast, affordable, and start around ₹2,500. Masticating juicers from brands like Kuvings are quieter, more efficient, and better at preserving nutrients, but typically start around ₹12,000.`,
    "Laptop": `
Finding your next laptop means balancing portability and power. Ultrabooks from Dell (XPS) and HP (Spectre) are thin, light, and great for work, while gaming laptops from Asus (ROG) pack powerful GPUs. Budget laptops start at ₹30,000, but high-end models like the MacBook Pro or top-tier gaming rigs can exceed ₹1,00,000. We test for performance, battery life, and display quality.`,
    "Microwave": `
A microwave is a kitchen staple for quickly reheating, defrosting, or even cooking meals. A 'Solo' model is the most basic, while 'Grill' models add browning capabilities. 'Convection' microwaves from brands like LG, Samsung, and IFB can also bake and roast, acting as a small oven. Prices range from ₹5,000 for solo models to ₹18,000 for larger convection units.`,
    "Mobile": `
Choosing a new smartphone involves navigating budget, mid-range, and flagship models from brands like Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus. The key differences often lie in camera quality, battery life, and processor speed. Budget phones under ₹15,000 offer great value, while flagships over ₹50,000 provide the absolute best performance and photography. We review the latest models to help you decide.`,
    "Refrigerator": `
A good refrigerator keeps your food fresh and can lower energy bills. Single-door fridges (starting at ₹12,000) are great for small families, while double-door and side-by-side models from LG, Samsung, and Whirlpool offer more storage and features like convertible freezers. Prices for larger models can range from ₹25,000 to over ₹50,000, depending on capacity and smart features.`,
    "TV": `
Upgrading your home entertainment setup means choosing between LED, QLED, and OLED panels. Standard 4K LED TVs from Mi or TCL offer great value, starting around ₹25,000. QLEDs from Samsung provide brighter, more vibrant colors, while OLEDs from Sony and LG are premium (starting ₹80,000+) and offer perfect blacks and the best contrast for a true cinematic experience.`,
    "Vaccum Cleaner": `
Keeping your floors spotless is easier with the right vacuum. Options range from portable handhelds (starting at ₹2,000) to powerful canister vacuums from Eureka Forbes. Lightweight, cordless stick vacuums are very convenient, with premium brands like Dyson offering high-end performance. Robotic vacuums offer automated cleaning for daily maintenance.`,
    "Water Purifier": `
Ensuring safe drinking water in India often requires a purifier. The technology you need depends on your water source. RO (Reverse Osmosis) is essential for hard water, while UV (Ultraviolet) kills bacteria and viruses. Top brands like Kent, Aquaguard, and Pureit often combine these in RO+UV models, which typically range from ₹8,0g00 to ₹20,000.`,
